# Independent Study Week One Intro/Plan
I have spent the first week checking out SASS and Earsketch as possible topics for my independent study. I had thought that SASS would be the clear winner for me, given tha fact that I had really loved working with CSS and HTML in my past years in SEP. I thought that it would be a smooth transition into SASS. It intrigued me because majority of the reviews/Code comparisions demonstrated that SASS had more flexibilty and allowed coders to get creative. Sass was creatiing amazing visuals, but I felt like I was not as much in control as I had in EarSketch. In earsketch I could *compose* music and code something I could really call my own. It helped that I already liked electric, dupstep music and was curious on what I could create if I followed the tutorial avalible on their site to the end.
##### Exploration Topics
1. SASS
###### What is it?
  * Is used to make CSS more powerful thorugh math and variables. It is a pre-processer and has easier syntax to work with. Sass is older than SCSS and is focused on indentations instead of brackets and colons to read the code.
  Examples of code are found at the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide) site

   
2. EarSketch
3###### What is it?
  * Is learning to code by making music. It works with python and javascript files. It is interactive, and easy to see ones progress. You can share out your music with peers and concentrate on incorprating all the learned skills to witness your own creation.
#### EarSketch Sandbox
```python
#		python code
#		script_name:Project Comp  
#		author:Jennifer     
#		description:Comp
#

from earsketch import *

init() #prepares the DAW to accept and play music
setTempo(140)

fitMedia(DUBSTEP_LEAD_003,1,1,7.5)
fitMedia(DUBSTEP_BASS_WOBBLE_002,2,5,7) #sound,tracknum,start,end
fitMedia(DUBSTEP_DRUMLOOP_MAIN_001,3,1,3)
fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE__5THCHORD_1,4,4,6)
finish()

```

#### Takeaways
 1. What I learned from my week of tinkering is that I like to see the progress happen with every line of code. I felt that Earsketch would allow me to harness my creativity and allow me to learn a whole new way code can change the lives of a person. It was an interesting way to be introduced to another part of computer science, that we have not learned in the classroom. I feel like I would start off with Earsketch, learn to use their code, and then learn SASS. 
 2.  I invisioned using the music as the background, changing tracks, almost like a playlist and designing a website-like tutorial showing simple tutorials, resources and end projects from other coders.
 3. I also learned that patience is key. I started off with SASS, downloaded the program recommended on their site, and immediatly wanted to see magic happening. It turned out that the app they recommended had to have been downloaded onto that, and it quickly made me want to switch topics. With a bit of tinkering it came to my knowledge that it can also be downloaded to C9.
