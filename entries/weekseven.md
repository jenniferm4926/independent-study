# Week Seven

##### Starting the Project
This week I had started thinking about what I wanted to do for my final project using Earsketch. My automatic approach was to code a website and have information for videos regarding music and then a tutorial explaining how it met the requirement described. I could not help but think that the people would also learn from looking at these blogs. So, I quickly skimmed the [jekyllrb site](https://jekyllrb.com/). The downfall to this idea was that I only had a week to learn Jekyll, and then add in the project, It was not likely that I would finish enough for me to show my true learning throughout the independent study.  

After a quick self evaluation, I felt like my blogs already seemed like a tutorial. I wanted to create something that I could be proud of and show off my work so my final option was to code a song, comment it and write my steps it took. It would be similar to the tutorial but it could be creative, and it could allow the person viewing it to tinker with the finished product as well.
```python
from earsketch import *
init()
setTempo(120)

#Music

# Create an A section

fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_DREAMPAD_002, 1, 1, 4.4) # main
fitMedia(HOUSE_BREAKBEAT_003, 2, 1.5, 4) # breakbeat
fitMedia(YG_TECHNO_DRUMS_2, 3, 1, 5) # drums

# Section B ( The different/change in the song)
fitMedia(RD_EDM_RAVECHORD_2, 1, 5, 9) # edm/electric vibe
fitMedia(ELECTRO_DRUM_MAIN_LOOPPART_010,2,6,8) #new drum tempo
fitMedia(RD_UK_HOUSE__5THCHORD_1, 3, 5, 9) # faster transition from YG
fitMedia(YG_ELECTRO_ELECTRIC_PIANO_2, 4, 4, 11) # backing

# Same A section

fitMedia(HOUSE_DEEP_DREAMPAD_002, 1, 10, 13.5) # main
fitMedia(HOUSE_BREAKBEAT_003, 2, 10.5, 13) # breakbeat
fitMedia(YG_TECHNO_DRUMS_2, 3, 9, 13) # drums

#Finish
finish()

 [Listen To It here](https://clyp.it/fiyk5cr0)
  * I started off with the code above to be the intro. For some reason I just could not see it working. It was functioning, there was no errors. But, It just did not sound right. It sounded like it would be something that belonged in the middle of a song because of the tempo and how disruptive it came off right away.I knew it would be a song I would immedietly skip, the beginning just had so much already going on. I was ready to pull the hair on my head off. I had made several changes and nothing was working.
  
##### Changing Directions
  * Shout Outs: Mr. Mueller & Walk off the Earth
    * I was running out of ideas on how to salvate my project. Mr. Mueller helped me by showing me songs done by Walk off the Earth. I was thinking too into grades and how points would affect my average instead of listening to the song. I listened to a few songs, and noticed how you should start off with an instrument combination that is not overpowering in order to have smoother transtions. By doing this, you could add more instruments  later on into the song to start a different section.
##### My advice?
  * DO Not give up. 
    * If you hit a bump, keep moving forward. I wanted to give up with my idea at first because I felt lost, like I did not know where to start. I had help to see what could give me inspiration, and listened to remixes to get an idea on how music should be categorized and sectioned off.
  * DO Research.
    * If you still have not finalized an idea of your project, research examples. I decided to create a song, but I did not have enough experience on Music, even though I knew how to code using Earsketch. Sometimes you need to be well rounded in several topics other than knowing how to code the project.
