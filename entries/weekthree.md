### Reflection/ What I learned
1. I learned that I have to be more precise and logical in making music. It's not just about putting sounds together, but it's also about seeing how different components mix together. By working with envelopes and overlapping bass, I've come to the decision of wanting to create music with a crossover of Techno and Electric since they share similar bpm.
2. I recommend to look at other projects similar to your topic to refine what you want to study more in depth. There might be time in the six weeks where you want to learn as much as possible,  but the sooner you have an idea on what you want to make, the more time you have to strengthen/ search for more information on how to use the components you actually need to create your project.
3. I learned that even if you're following a tutorial/website they don't always explain every term. Sometimes you have to google specific questions about your topic, which in my case was music and learn more about that in order to learn to use the right arguments to create music on EarSketch.
